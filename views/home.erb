<h1 class="title"><b>ROCK, PAPER SCISSORS</b></h1>

<p class="desc"><i>"Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". It has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors, but will lose to one who has played paper; a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie."</i></p>
